## what is this
this page was created using a tool called [domino][1]. it is a spatial
arrangement of cards that together might form an essay or a mind map or a 
collage or something else entirely.

click and drag to navigate the board. double click a card to jump to it. some
cards have emoji icons along the bottom that perform various actions when 
clicked.

this page is also a working copy of domino. toggle into unlocked mode with
the ðŸ”“ icon on the toolbar, and made your own changes.
