<h2>about</h2>
<p>domino is a tool for collaging fragmented thoughts into a larger idea.
it's essentially a tool for making a particular kind of mindmap and sharing it
as a page on your website or itch.io.</p>
<p>you can find out more about domino on <a href="https://kool.tools/domino/">the release page</a>. the source
code for original releases can be found <a href="https://github.com/Ragzouken/domino">on github</a>.</p>
<p>i'm <a href="https://twitter.com/ragzouken">mark wonnacott a.k.a candle</a> and i created domino as a
<a href="https://kool.tools/2020/02/26/speculations.html">response to my frustration</a> trying to express myself in Emilie Reed's
writing jams.</p>
<h2>thanks</h2>

deeply inspired me and also motivated the creation of this tool. also for
certain flippant comments that pushed me into developing web based tools.</p>
<p><strong>Max</strong> for <a href="https://github.com/synth-ruiner/image-to-bitsy">image to bitsy</a> whose source code was a valuable reference for
developing web tools. also for feedback and bug reports.</p>
<p><strong>sg</strong> for <a href="https://zenzoa.itch.io/mosi">môsi</a> whose source code was a valuable reference for developing
web tools. also for feedback and bug reports.</p>
<p><strong>Kris De Decker</strong> for <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/">LOW←TECH MAGAZINE</a> which continues to inspire me to
think about how computing and software can and must change in the future. also
the aesthetic inspiration for the default style in domino.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Klimas</strong> for <a href="https://twinery.org/">Twine</a> whose card based layout and ecosystem of user
customisation is an inspiration to domino.</p>
