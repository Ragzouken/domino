# domino
## about
domino is a tool for collaging fragmented thoughts into a larger idea. 
it's essentially a tool for making a particular kind of mindmap and sharing it
as a page on your website or itch.io.

i'm [mark wonnacott a.k.a candle][me] and i created domino as a 
[response to my frustration][0] trying to express myself in Emilie Reed's
writing jams.

## info
the original source code for domino is available on [github][source].

## thanks
**Em Reed** for [Manifesto Jam][3] and [Speculation Jam][4] which have
deeply inspired me and also motivated the creation of this tool. also for 
certain flippant comments that pushed me into developing web based tools.

**Max** for [image to bitsy][5] whose source code was a valuable reference for
developing web tools. also for feedback and bug reports.
 
**sg** for [môsi][9] whose source code was a valuable reference for developing
web tools. also for feedback and bug reports.

**Kris De Decker** for [LOW←TECH MAGAZINE][6] which continues to inspire me to
think about how computing and software can and must change in the future. also
the aesthetic inspiration for the default style in domino.

**Chris Klimas** for [Twine][7] whose card based layout and ecosystem of user
customisation is an inspiration to domino.
